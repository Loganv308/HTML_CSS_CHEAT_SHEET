# winston-better-sqlite3  
*aka wbs*

`sqite3` Transport for [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)

## Install

```bash
$ npm install winston-better-sqlite3
```
## Use

```js
const winston = require('winston');

const wbs = require('winston-better-sqlite3');
const logger = winston.createLogger({
    level: 'info',
    format: winston.format.json(),
    transports: [
        new wbs({

            // 'db' is required, and should include the full 
            // path to the sqlite3 database file on the disk
            db: '<name of sqlite3 database file>',

            // The name of the table to use in the database.
            // Defaults to 'log'
            table: 'log',

            // A list of the log params to log. Defaults to 
            // ['level, 'message']. These params are used as 
            // columns in the sqlite3 table
            params: ['level', 'resource', 'query', 'message']
        })
    ]
});
```

There are a couple of `sqlite3` transports for Winston out there, but this one is different. For one, it uses Josuha Wise's most excellent [better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3) package. Second, in my biased opinion, `wbs` is also better because it uses no ORMs or any such middleware. It is just a plain, no-nonsense transport that writes the logs to a `sqlite3` database. You have to provide the name of (and path to) the database file and optionally the table name (defaults to `log`), but the module creates the table (if it doesn't already exist) with the following four columns by default

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp INTEGER DEFAULT (strftime('%s','now')),
    level TEXT,
    message TEXT
);
```

Later on, in your program where you want to log something

```js
// the following two messages will be logged
logger.log({
    level: 'info',
    resource: 'collaborators',
    query: 'q=punkish',
    message: 'searching for folks'
});

logger.log({
    level: 'error',
    resource: 'collaboratoradoras',
    query: 'q=normal',
    message: 'searching for state'
});

// the following message will not be logged because 
// its level is less important than the log level
logger.log({
    level: 'verbose',
    resource: 'funding',
    query: 'q=normal&something',
    message: 'searching for habbine'
});
```

**Note:** The user has to provide only the name of the `sqlite3` database file. The module will create a database if it doesn't already exist (as `sqlite3` always does), and will create a table of a given name (`log` by default) inside the database if the table doesn't already exist. 

The `id` and `timestamp` columns are automatically inserted by `sqlite3`. The user can provide whatever others columns needed for tracking logging info. For example, I use `level`, `resource`, `query` and `message` in one of my projects (as shown in the example above). All logging params are stored in columns of datatype `TEXT`.
